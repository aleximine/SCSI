The Four Virtues

Long ago, during the creation of our world, There was a family, where each member was blessed with the embodiment of four virtues; Virility, Adaptability, Strength, and Intelligence.
However, these virtues were easily overcome by Greed.
This Greed overtook their minds, a lust for power in which their Virtues would bring them to.
The Greed connected them all, a common goal. Let this Greed roam free, they wished. Let these Virtues be our trump card, they thought. All of the world is within our grasp, they knew.
They all thought that nothing could match them in their Virtues, and that was their undoing. Not every problem can be solved with one Virtue.

Virility was matched by a heat it cannot relieve.
Adaptability was matched by an object it cannot see.
Strength was matched by a realm it cannot touch.
Intelligence was matched by a place they cannot think.

And thus Greed was destroyed by taking away the virtues which held that Greed alive.


Now, you see what bad a positive trait can have, and why you should never get cocky because you may be better than someone else at a certain thing.
