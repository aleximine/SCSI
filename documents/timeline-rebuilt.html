1871: The first mine in the Gwinn area is created.

1905: Gwinn Mine is founded in the northern peninsula of Michigan. A permanent mining town is built to house the miners and their families from 1907 to 1910.
1927: Gwinn Mine is shut down, and then reopened by "Rolling Mill Mining Co." and renamed to Archibald Mine.
1936: Archibald Mine ceases shipment of iron.

1942: Archibald Mine is bought out by █████████. Scrap amounts of iron are found in stockpile, and are shipped out.

1969: ARPANET is created; the precursor to modern internet.

197X: Airborne pathogen is noticed to be spreading globally, killing off the human population at a rapid rate.
1980: 'Refuge Tower' built near Archibald Mine, used to stockpile medical supplies in case grant deliveries are halted.
1985: Major corporations shut down due to disease, global R&D focuses on a cure. Refuge Tower completes construction; over a hundred floors are made, putting everyone determined not infected and able to read and write working on potential cures.
1986: Standard technology progress such as computers halts, so everyone is using Macintosh Plus as the world ends.

199X: Underground testing cells are built beneath Refuge Tower, researching DNA manipulation in secret. Accessed through the Archibald Mine elevator to a depth of 400 meters
199X: DL Stability Testing; Mask removal is initially unsuccessful, crystalline core deemed nessesary for molecular stability. Genetic alteration using outside DNA begins to circumvent mask necessity.
200X: Fusion Testing begins. Attribute manipulation through artificial pigments.
200X: GL-01 through GL-04 created through DL Stability Testing. 01 through 03 are put into cryostasis, to keep alive for further research.

201X: Town surrounding Refuge Tower is burned to the ground in a last-ditch effort to prevent contagion.
201X: 'Tier 3' Project created between two of the remaining scientists in an attempt to prevent extinction, unbeknownst to other staff. The Refuge Tower secretary becomes involved, as a means of acquring materials from the tower.

2018: Continual usage of Tier 3 causes temporal fluctuations, and the project is shut down.
2018: DL Stability Testing resumes. Spacetime weakness causes occassional connection to other earth, sending JW into the Refuge Tower.
2019: DL Stability Testing is complete. MDL strand is stabilized enough to hold a physical form.
2019: DLS-MDL Test Failure. Subject escapes test environment.
2019: Insulation on Latex Morph cells faults due to damage from Shadow Goo, allowing ELF telepathy signals to travel between cells.
2019: Magenta Latex Morph escapes. Floor B2 Research Staff cubicles are destroyed. Only remaining data and chemicals stored within Floor B3 closet.

20XX: Research upon DLS Species is conducted by external organization 0-Z.
20XX: DLS-1 (Uki), DLS-2 (Nari) and Seer pass away, leaving their history carved into the walls of their original cell, marked with handprints from DLS-1 & 2, and blood of all three dried into the engraving.

2XXX: Dark Snep population exceeds available space in the Underground Lab. DLS begin taking apart walls and find limestone cave network.

Following these events, the population of the Dark Snep species began to increase. By the third generation, the walls of the laboratory had been taken apart, carved onto, and otherwise tampered with to open a pathway to the limestone cave network which sat at the core of Archibald Mine.
