Su626A65ct fusion began today. We used your recommendation of including Iodine this time, as a backup additive in case this batch goes poorly. We're running out of space down here.
By the way, I've started using my e-mail as a to-do list ever since one of the janitors dropped a crate on our box of diskettes. :^)

Heya Cara,
How's work up there?

They're barely recognizable as a snow leopard anymore. Do you think the Iodine affected which DNA strain took priority in their bodies? Anyway, here's some notes Wilfred and I have taken on them;

Most MDL subjects have a ring of chest fur, and their rosettes have vanished completely in all cases. They have inherited the weakness to light shown by the MDL donor species, yet strangely at a more extreme level. The most likely culprit is the iodine, which didn't bond well in their bodies. This morning, we lost one due to the elevator lights. Hard to tell from the camera, but the body was apart almost instantly when the elevator opened.
They also have been docile, if that's the right word for it. They exhibit a high level of fear towards us and anything else. It's something new, at least... but not helpful.
We separated one from the rest last week to see its behavior when alone; it refused to move or eat.
They appear sentient, though do not understand speech. They have not made any vocalizations as of yet.

=================================================

To all staff,
Until further notice, all elevators leading to the ground floor will be out of service due to an emergency lockdown. A break-in occurred at the roof, at 7:28 PM, September 24, 2018.
[@TIER3     It is advised that all DNA subjects are locked down within cells. Any unaccounted for will be disposed of by staff.]

The official report is as follows:
Last night, the Refuge Tower was subject to a break-in. There is an unknown person wandering around the upper levels of the building. Most likely, they managed to shut off cameras on the roof and snuck in. Their identity is unknown.

Thank you.

they have been eating the donor bodies as well. we aren't sure why yet, but it doesn't bode well.

The computer in my office has been making weird noises the past few days. It probably got damaged by the MLM, and the SCSI port doesn't seem to work, so I can't export the old documents.
The offworlder Jay W. has been calling the MDL-DLS subjects 'Dark Sneps', despite there barely being any leopard left in them. It's not that great a name, but I haven't come up with anything better.
