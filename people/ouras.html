    <p>Heather Ouras exhibits differering personalities in each brain. The central head is used as visual sensory input and for expressing the thoughts of all three brains.
      Subject insists against being referred to as 'they'; with the reasoning that significant effort is put into managing the needs of all three brains as one cohesive unit.
      Heather Ouras is a direct descendant of OLM of the <span class="obfuscated">REBUILT</span> DNA tests. She has inherited a majority of the phenotypes exhibited by OLM; however displays a fur pattern similar to YLM; this is likely due to having a lower concentraction of ink components within DNA. It is likely that ink-related attributes will be bred out within the next two generations.
    Other differences appear to parallel OLM's characteristics: possessesing a single set of eyes in total across three heads, while OLM possesses three sets of eyes.
    The central head generally stays mostly in control of Heather's body, with the exception of a secondary set of arms controlled solely by the secondary heads.
