  <h2>Hot Springs</h2>
  <div class="typed">
    <p>A well-used trail winds out from the wooden, ornate house in the mountains.
    In the frigid air, the wispy clouds of your breath hang beyond your eyes.
    It pales in comparison to the rising steam above.
    
    The family that resides in this peak has bare access to water. This high in the mountain, wells and pipes will freeze.
    This path leads to a hot spring — open to the world, yet secluded.
    This family is at peace with exposing themself to the cold air, and to whoever else needs to cleanse themselves.</p>
