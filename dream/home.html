    <p>The cold air bites your nose.
    
    It has been only twenty minutes since you left the train station at the foot of the mountain. It has felt like much, much more.
    The path you have taken to climb has been walled by rocks, blocking any hope of using a vehicle to traverse it. At the same time, the rocks have protected you from gusts of wind that would have chilled you to your bones.
    You were invited here, by a friend who returned here to see his family for the holidays.
    You wonder how vibrant it could be in the summer, and how much easier the journey would have been in... nicer weather.
    These thoughts fill the time, stretching it both fast and slow. 
    But you've made it. The path flattens out, almost widely enough to forget you are on a mountain...
    
    His home. His birthplace.
    
    Before you, is the place you have pushed forward to see.
    The building invites you closer. Maroon woodknots within deep-hued, lacquered aspen stare at you, guarding you from harm.
    You step inside. A square of packed dirt steals the snow from your boots as you walk over it, and towards a pale yellow overhang in the floor.
    He greets you in open arms. a white robe is tied at his hips, spotless fabric breaking way to his warm fur as he welcomes you with a hug.
    
    It's warm...
    
    
    
    You feel as though your worries were left outside.
